TODO: decide name and purpose
    inspiration         a vague input that determines the idea-space of the generation. Doesn't guarantee anything.
                        Should be verifiable.
                        If none is given, a random inspiration is chosen by Lyrist.

    intention, goal     a more specific input that represents the software's goal. Impossible to guarantee, but there is a high chance that Lyrist follows the intention and creates a elements with the intended emotional arc (somewhere is the idea-space of the given Inspiration).
                        Should be verifiable.
                        If none is given, a random intention is chosen by Lyrist.

    dream               a very cool name, sounds like it means wacky, complex ideas for intentions and goals that Lyrist gets.
    plan                the concrete rules that Lyrist is bound to adhere to, or at least log or downscore a rule value whenever it breaks a rule. Could help customize filtration.
                        Example content: stanza structure, rhyme scheme, exclude a particular word, score above .7 on flamboyancy,
                            score below .2 on similarity to template, completely change half the lines of a stanza by using n-grams
                            Rule: correct grammar only. Rule: pre-50's words only. Rule: 3 stanzas all in limmerick form
